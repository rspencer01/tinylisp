# My Tiny Lisp

This is a toy tiny lisp interpreter.

It is not for any real world usage. It was mostly a learning experience for me.

It is supported by [dryad](https://github.com/rspencer01/dryad), and was chosen as a simple AST for that editor.

You can run a program by
```bash
$ tinylisp my_program.tinylisp
```
You can format a program by
```bash
$ tinylisp --format my_program.tinylisp
```
Both also accept `-` for standard input.

Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/rspencer01/tinylisp/blob/master/examples) for some applications.
